# Password-Generator
This is a simple python based program which everytime used will create a random string of required lenght and also store it in  a file in encypted form  ,You just need to remeber a  single password of the program and every other passsword will be managed by my program

Password are stored in encypted mode so that no one else can view them without the main password , if one even try to decrypt any password they will fail as it is not possible without the main pass of the program

This program  has the ability to detect wether it has any data in ditectory in which it is running and is it detect that it is being run succesfully first time in the directory it promt user to set a main password and generate and dtore password.

This program can be use my multiple user on same device  by just running it in different directory

No use of any external library is used for encryption which allow this program to even run on device without pyencrypt library and other.


Update:
A master password feature so that only authorised people can access coming soon , also with encryption based on master password
